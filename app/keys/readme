##Spotify API
Both a client ID and a client secret are needed to generate an access token that can be used to make API calls
To get credentials:
- Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard and log in with your Spotify account (or make one)
- Create an app, fill in with any app name/description/redirect url, select "Web API", and agree to terms
- Open your app page, go to settings, find "Client ID" and "Client Secret", copy and paste into respective txt files
On the app page, you are also able to see the quantity of API requests and users run.
